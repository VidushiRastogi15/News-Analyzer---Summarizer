## CHALLANGES & SOLUTION
<li><b>Challanges</b> :
Cost Implications with OpenAI API: Initially, our project planned to leverage OpenAI API for text summarization. However, we encountered the challenge of associated costs with using the OpenAI API, which may not align with our budget constraints.

<b>Solution</b> : 
Transition to Hugging Face LLM: In response to the cost challenges posed by OpenAI API, we made a strategic decision to transition to Hugging Face‚Äôs Language Models (LLMs) for text summarization. Hugging Face provides a rich collection of pre-trained models, including some eÔ¨Äicient and cost-eÔ¨Äective options for our summarization needs.</li>

<li><b>Challanges</b> :
One challenge encountered was the inability of the UnstructuredURLLoader to fetch content from links in the desired format. Despite its basic functionality for making HTTP requests and retrieving web page data, it lacked the robust parsing capabilities necessary to extract structured content, particularly from complex HTML documents.

<b>Solution</b> : 
As a solution, we opted to utilize the Beautiful Soup library, which excels in parsing HTML and XML documents, providing a flexible and intuitive API for navigating the parse tree and extracting relevant content.</li>

## CONCLUSION
<p>The goal is to simplify the news consumption process, oÔ¨Äering users a time-saving solution that distills relevant information from the vast and varied landscape of news content.</p>
